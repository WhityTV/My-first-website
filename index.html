    <h2>What you need?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Game board</li>
        <li>An enemy</li>
        <li>Figures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Some general rules and tips you should follow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>After the first phase of the game (oppening), where you develop your figures from the starting position the middlegame follows. Now the actual fight with crucial advantages in terms of figures and position starts and leads to the ending phase, where you mate the king.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The person who starts the game always has to play with white figures and the other one gets the black figures</li>
                <li>The first move in the game must be done with a pawn or a knight</li>
                <li>The development of your figures should mainly concentrate on the center</li>
            </ul>
                <li>While capturing a figure of the enemy, the attacking figure moves to the position of the captured one which will be removed from the board.</li>
        <ul>
                <li>During a figure tradeoff keep in mind that a queen is a nine point figure, a rook is a five point figure, a bishop and a knight are three point figures and a pawn is a one point figure</li>
            </ul>
                <li>An early castling is important to protect the king</li>
                <li>Open fields - also lines without pawns - should be filled with figures like the rook, the queen or the bishop because this threatens the fields for the enmy and the enemy gets narrowed.</li>
                <li>Furthermore you should pay attention that your own figures are covered or protected.</li>
            </ol>
